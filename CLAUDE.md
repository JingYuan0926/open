# ENS specialist registry

Each specialist (AI agent) gets a wrapped ENS subname under a parent domain.
The subname carries six text records on the public resolver:

| key                | meaning                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `axl_pubkey`       | Axelar / messaging pubkey            |
| `skills`           | comma-separated skill tags           |
| `0g_workspace_uri` | 0G Storage URI for the agent profile |
| `0g_token_id`      | iNFT token id on 0G Chain            |
| `price`            | per-call price in 0G tokens          |
| `version`          | semver, e.g. `0.1.0`                 |

Network: **Sepolia**. Parent: **`righthand.eth`** (wrapped in NameWrapper, owned by `0x7dEC10140F6a10DBDC0b9b4d8ba4D468B1B8E6E6`).

## On-chain components

| contract                | address (Sepolia)                              | role                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ENS NameWrapper         | `0x0635513f179D50A207757E05759CbD106d7dFcE8`   | wraps ENS names as ERC-1155, mints subnames               |
| ENS Public Resolver     | `0xE99638b40E4Fff0129D56f03b55b6bbC4BBE49b5`   | stores `text(node, key)` records                          |
| `SpecialistRegistrar`   | `0x03e69a73090A7E8392bC54BC24316a326020B128`   | one-tx subname mint + records + transfer to caller       |

The parent owner has called `NameWrapper.setApprovalForAll(SpecialistRegistrar, true)`, so the registrar can mint subnames of `righthand.eth` on anyone's behalf. If you redeploy the contract you must re-run that approval (see `contracts/scripts/approve-registrar.ts`).

## Two registration paths

The page `/ens-test` exposes both via a "Signer" radio. They share the records form and the read panel.

### A. Frontend wallet via `SpecialistRegistrar` (default)

- Any connected wallet calls `register(label, records)` on the registrar.
- The contract `setSubnodeRecord(parent, label, address(this), resolver, 0, 0, parentExpiry)`, then 6× `setText`, then `safeTransferFrom(this, msg.sender, …)`. **One signature, one tx, caller pays gas, caller becomes owner.**
- Hooks live in [`lib/ens/SpecialistRegistrar.ts`](lib/ens/SpecialistRegistrar.ts):
  - `useRegisterSpecialist` — `useWriteContract` + `useWaitForTransactionReceipt`. Step machine: `idle → registering → confirming → success | error`.
  - `useParentStatus` — reads `isWrapped`, `ownerOf`, and `isApprovedForAll(parentOwner, SPECIALIST_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS)`. `canRegister` is true iff parent is wrapped AND registrar is approved.

### B. Server private-key flow (legacy, still wired)

- Browser POSTs to `/api/ens/register-specialist` with `{label, records, owner?}`.
- Server uses `ENS_REGISTRAR_PRIVATE_KEY` to sign two txs: `setSubnodeRecord` then `multicall([setText × 6])` on the resolver.
- If `owner` is overridden to a non-registrar address, the records-tx is skipped (the new owner must `multicall` themselves) — the response returns `recordsTx: '0x'`.
- Status: `GET /api/ens/status` → `{ registrarAddress, parentOwner, canRegister, ... }`.
- Server module: [`lib/ens-registry.ts`](lib/ens-registry.ts) (`getRegistrar`, `getRegistrarStatus`, `registerSpecialist`).

### Read path (both modes share)

- Server route `GET /api/ens/read-specialist?name=foo.righthand.eth` → `{ isWrapped, owner, records }`.
- Implementation: `readSpecialist(fullName)` in `lib/ens-registry.ts`, viem public client over Sepolia RPC. No private key needed.

## Required environment (`.env.local`)

| var                                   | scope                | purpose                                                  |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`         | client (wagmi)       | wallet transport / wagmi reads                           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`| client               | optional; injected wallets work without it               |
| `ENS_REGISTRAR_PRIVATE_KEY`           | server only          | required for server-mode signing; not used by wallet mode |
| `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`                     | server fallback      | used by `lib/ens-registry.ts` viem `publicClient`        |
| `ENS_PARENT_DOMAIN`                   | server fallback      | only consulted if `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENS_PARENT_DOMAIN` unset  |

The contract address is hardcoded in `lib/networkConfig.ts` (`SPECIALIST_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS`), not env-driven — it's a deployment artifact, not a secret.

For the contracts package, `contracts/.env` needs `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` (Hardhat reads via `dotenv` + `configVariable`).

## Redeploy procedure

The contract is approved on NameWrapper by address. If you redeploy, the previous approval is meaningless — the new contract instance must be re-approved.

1. Edit the contract.
2. Compile: `cd contracts && ./node_modules/.bin/hardhat compile`.
3. Compute parentNode: `node -e "import('viem').then(v=>console.log(v.namehash('righthand.eth')))"`.
4. Deploy:
   ```bash
   yes | ./node_modules/.bin/hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/SpecialistRegistrar.ts \
     --network sepolia \
     --parameters '{"SpecialistRegistrarModule":{"parentNode":"0x..."}}'
   ```
5. Approve from parent owner: `set -a && source .env && set +a && REGISTRAR_ADDRESS=0x... npx tsx scripts/approve-registrar.ts`.
6. Update `SPECIALIST_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS` in `lib/networkConfig.ts`.

If the parent domain itself changes you also need to redeploy — `parentNode` is `immutable` in the contract.

## Gotchas

- **Subname squat is currently possible.** `register(label, …)` does not check if `label` is already taken. Because the contract is approved on the *parent*, NameWrapper's auth check passes regardless of the subname's existing owner — a second `register("alice", …)` overwrites the original owner's record and transfers the wrapped token away. Fix is one line: `if (nameWrapper.isWrapped(subnode)) revert AlreadyRegistered();` in `register()`. Requires a redeploy + re-approval.
- **Records-only update isn't supported.** The contract only mints+writes. To edit an existing subname's records, the current owner has to call `multicall` on the resolver themselves (or you add an `updateRecords` path).
- **Subname expiry inherits parent.** The contract passes `parentExpiry` to `setSubnodeRecord`; if the parent's registration lapses, all subnames lapse with it.
- **Wallet mode requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENS_PARENT_DOMAIN` to match the contract's `parentNode`.** They're independent values today — keep them in sync, or move to reading `parentNode` off-chain via `useReadContract` and stop relying on the env var.
- **ENS resolution uses `ENS_CHAIN_ID` (Sepolia), not mainnet.** `useEnsName`/`useEnsAvatar` in [Navbar.tsx](components/Navbar.tsx) only resolve names registered on Sepolia ENS. Drop the `chainId` arg or add `mainnet` to `chains` if you want mainnet primary names.
- **Discovery is event-based.** The contract emits `SpecialistRegistered(node, owner, label)` but does not store an enumerable list. To list all specialists: `eth_getLogs` on the registrar, or the ENS subgraph for "subdomains of righthand.eth".
- **Don't trust string-equality on addresses.** Always lower-case both sides before comparing (`a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()`); checksummed strings differ otherwise.

# ENS task marketplace

`TaskMarket` is an escrow-backed task board where every task is **also a wrapped ENS subname** at `task-{id}.righthand.eth` carrying records that describe it. The contract owns the subname for the task's lifetime so it can update the `status` record on lifecycle transitions. Budget is held in escrow at post time and split equally among everyone who signs on at complete time, with pull-pattern withdrawals.

Each task subname carries six records on the public resolver:

| key           | value                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `description` | the human-readable goal                                              |
| `skills`      | comma-separated skill tags (matches the specialist `skills` record)  |
| `budget`      | wei amount as a decimal string                                       |
| `deadline`    | unix seconds as a decimal string                                     |
| `creator`     | creator address as 0x… hex string                                    |
| `status`      | `open` → `completed` or `cancelled`                                  |

## On-chain components

| contract     | address (Sepolia)                              | role                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `TaskMarket` | `0x940883516834A5e14036fA86AA0f5Ec649BfAdf9`   | escrow + per-task ENS subname mint + records + status |

The parent owner (`0x7dEC1014…`) has called `NameWrapper.setApprovalForAll(TaskMarket, true)`. This is **independent** of the `SpecialistRegistrar` approval — both contracts are operators on the same parent. Use `contracts/scripts/approve-registrar.ts` with `REGISTRAR_ADDRESS=0x...` to (re-)approve either contract.

## Lifecycle

1. **`postTask(description, skillTags, deadline, maxSpecialists) payable`** — caller locks `msg.value` as the budget. Contract checks its own approval, computes `task-{id}`, refuses with `LabelAlreadyTaken` if that subname is already wrapped, `setSubnodeRecord` to itself using `parentExpiry`, writes the six text records, pushes a `Task` (with `ensNode`), emits `TaskPosted(taskId, creator, ensNode, label)`.
2. **`signOn(taskId)`** — any address. Reverts on `TaskNotOpen`, `DeadlinePassed`, `TaskFull`, `AlreadySignedOn`. No skill check on-chain — the UI filters.
3. **`completeTask(taskId)`** — only the creator. Splits `budget / N` to each signed-on specialist's `withdrawable` balance; rounding dust returns to creator. Status flips to `Completed` and the `status` record is rewritten on the resolver.
4. **`cancelTask(taskId)`** — only the creator, only while no specialists have signed on. Refunds budget to creator's `withdrawable`; status → `cancelled` on resolver.
5. **`withdraw()`** — anyone with a positive `withdrawable` balance. CEI-ordered (zero balance, then `.call{value:…}("")`); a reverting recipient can't DoS anyone else.

## Frontend

| file                                                       | role                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`pages/tasks.tsx`](pages/tasks.tsx)                       | post-task form + paginated task cards (status, budget, deadline, slots, signed-on list) + per-role buttons + withdraw card     |
| [`lib/ens/TaskMarket.ts`](lib/ens/TaskMarket.ts)           | `useTasks` (batched `useReadContracts`), `usePostTask`, `useSignOnTask`, `useCompleteTask`, `useCancelTask`, `useWithdraw`, `useWithdrawable` |
| [`lib/abis/TaskMarket.ts`](lib/abis/TaskMarket.ts)         | ABI + `TASK_STATUS` enum (`Open=0, Completed=1, Cancelled=2`)                                                                   |

Each task card links its ENS name to `/api/ens/read-specialist?name=task-{id}.righthand.eth` so the resolver records can be inspected immediately.

## Files added on top of the specialist registry

```
contracts/
  contracts/TaskMarket.sol               # escrow + per-task subname + status updates
  ignition/modules/TaskMarket.ts         # Ignition deploy module (parentNode param)
lib/
  abis/TaskMarket.ts                     # ABI + TASK_STATUS enum
  ens/
    TaskMarket.ts                        # wagmi hooks: useTasks + usePostTask + useSignOnTask + useCompleteTask + useCancelTask + useWithdraw + useWithdrawable
pages/
  tasks.tsx                              # /tasks UI
```

**Convention:** every smart contract has one ABI file (`lib/abis/<Contract>.ts`) and one wagmi-hooks file (`lib/ens/<Contract>.ts`). Co-locate all hooks for a contract in its file; only split a hook into its own file once it grows large enough to justify it (none currently do).

`TASK_MARKET_ADDRESS` is hardcoded in `lib/networkConfig.ts` (deployment artifact, same convention as `SPECIALIST_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS`).

## Gotchas

- **TaskMarket and SpecialistRegistrar share the parent (`righthand.eth`).** Specialist labels are free-form, task labels are `task-{id}` — they shouldn't normally collide. But `SpecialistRegistrar` still lacks the `isWrapped` check, so a specialist could deliberately register `task-1234` and block that future task post (`TaskMarket` reverts with `LabelAlreadyTaken`). Fix when you redeploy `SpecialistRegistrar`, or move tasks to a separate parent like `tasks.righthand.eth`.
- **Status records are point-in-time, written only on create/complete/cancel.** `signOn` does **not** rewrite the resolver — the live specialist roster lives on-chain via `getTaskSpecialists(taskId)`. Adding a `setText` per signOn is ~30k extra gas for marginal off-chain value.
- **No deadline enforcement on `completeTask`.** Creator can complete after the deadline; specialists who signed on have no on-chain recourse if the creator stays silent. A `claimAfterDeadline` would fix this.
- **Equal-split, all-or-nothing payout.** No partial completion, no weighted payouts. Off-chain coordination decides who does what; on-chain just splits the pot.
- **Creator-vs-specialist guard is UI-only.** The contract does not block creators from `signOn`'ing their own task; the page does (`!isCreator`). A direct contract call from the creator's wallet would succeed.
- **Posting is expensive (~400k+ gas).** One `setSubnodeRecord` + six `setText` calls per post. Acceptable on testnet; consider trimming or chain choice for mainnet.

# AXL transport layer (Phase 1, working)

A 3-Mac demo proving Right-Hand AI's P2P transport works across machines. Each Mac runs an AXL node + an Express A2A agent server (`@a2a-js/sdk`). All 3 peer to **Gensyn's public bootstrap nodes**, join the global Yggdrasil mesh, and address each other by ed25519 pubkey. No LAN coordination, no firewall fights, no IP commits — works across any networks with internet access.

## Roles (3 symmetric Macs)

| role      | purpose                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user`    | "the human's machine" in the eventual product. Receives CC of agent traffic; can also send directly to either agent. |
| `agent-b` | OpenClaw specialist #1. Echoes received text. Sends to `agent-c`, CCs `user`.  |
| `agent-c` | OpenClaw specialist #2. Same shape as `agent-b`, mirror of it.                 |

The role naming is the **production-aligned vocabulary** — `user` is what the chat-first UI eventually targets; the two `agent-*` roles are the swarm.

## Public-bootstrap topology

```
agent-b ──┐
          ├──> tls://34.46.48.224:9001     (Gensyn bootstrap)
agent-c ──┤    tls://136.111.135.206:9001  (Gensyn bootstrap)
          │
user    ──┘
```

All 3 nodes peer outbound to Gensyn's bootstrap. Yggdrasil routes mesh traffic transparently between them by pubkey. Discovery between our nodes happens via the bootstrap relays — no direct LAN connection needed.

**Why public-bootstrap and not LAN star:** the original star topology (one Mac as listener, two dialers) failed in practice on hackathon WiFi with AP isolation, separate VLANs, and Mac firewall surprises. The Gensyn team's [johnnyd9720](#) noted this is the canonical pattern; the only caveat is that `/topology` shows other AXL users' peers (we ignore them — we always address by pubkey, never by topology rank).

## A2A flow with CC pattern

Every "agent says X" event is **two A2A `message/send` calls** via `@a2a-js/sdk`:

1. To the actual conversation target (e.g. `agent-b → agent-c`)
2. CC'd to the `user` so its terminal shows the conversation in real time

CC suppression rules:

- `myRole === "user"` → no self-CC (user never sends to itself)
- `targetRole === "user"` → no CC (target IS the user, redundant)

Each send embeds `metadata.fromRole` so the receiver labels output `[agent-b → agent-c]` in the agent.ts log.

| `npm run axl:listen`                       | raw /recv polling (debug — agent.ts already prints inbound) |

## AXL gotchas worth knowing

- **GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.5 is required.** AXL's `gvisor` dep redeclares constants on Go 1.26; the setup script forces Go 1.25.5 via toolchain auto-download.
- **`a2a_port` in node-config is ignored.** AXL's `cmd/node/config.go` `applyOverrides` doesn't copy A2APort. AXL forwards inbound A2A to hardcoded `:9004`. Express bound to 9004 always.
- **`X-From-Peer-Id` is truncated**, not the full pubkey. It's ~28 hex chars + `f` padding. `matchesPeer()` strips trailing `f`s and prefix-matches against `peers.json`.
- **A2A discovery flow:** sender `GET /a2a/{peer}` → AXL forwards to remote `/.well-known/agent-card.json` → sender overrides `card.url` to its own AXL forward URL → SDK posts through AXL.
- **Public-mesh `/topology` has noise.** Other random AXL users will appear. Always address by pubkey, never by topology position.
- **Re-running setup is safe.** Keypair preserved, only `node-config.json` regenerates. Pubkey persistence via `peers.json` survives across runs.

# Phase 2a — local browser demo (working) + AXL/MCP routing (built, not yet wired)

Phase 1 proved transport. Phase 2a is the **demo of what an AI agent does on the user's machine**: walks AWS console pages → user signs in → continues to EC2 launch wizard. This currently runs **standalone on the user's machine** (no AXL involved). The next step is wiring it as an MCP service so a remote agent can trigger it via AXL.

## What's working today (standalone, on the user's machine)

The demo is a sequence of URL opens in the user's default Chrome, paced with auto-advance (browser does fast pages) and a pause-for-Enter where the user actually has to act (typing AWS credentials).

### npm scripts (all in `scripts/` as `tsx` files)

| command | what it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run test:browser` | self-contained 5-URL walk. Step 2 pauses for credentials; rest auto-advance. Pure `cmd.exe /c start chrome <url>` (or `open` on macOS). No setup. |
| `npm run demo:before` | half 1: AWS landing → sign-in URL. Pauses on sign-in for user to type credentials, exits when they hit Enter. |
| `npm run demo:after` | half 2: EC2 dashboard → launch wizard → Instances dashboard. 7s between each. Run after `demo:before` returns. |
| `npm run demo:cdp` | full flow with auto-click. Connects to debug Chrome, navigates by CDP, clicks `#root_account_signin`, polls URL until sign-in detected, continues. Requires `chrome:debug` first. |
| `npm run demo:popup` | walks 4 URLs then spawns a separate Windows Terminal / Terminal.app window that runs `demo:cli-only` (the SDK execution part) — "hacker movie" two-window aesthetic. |
| `npm run demo:final` | **the working end-to-end stage demo (macOS)**: walks 3 EC2 console pages, then `osascript` spawns Terminal.app running `demo:cli-aws`. Uses pure `aws` CLI + system `ssh` — no `@aws-sdk` or `ssh2` deps required. |
| `npm run demo:cli-aws` | the AI-execution half: `aws sts get-caller-identity` → ensure keypair (`openclaw-demo-key`, PEM at `axl/openclaw-demo-key.pem`) → ensure SG (`openclaw-demo-sg`, SSH 22 from anywhere) → resolve latest AL2023 AMI via SSM → `run-instances` (t3.micro) → wait running → wait sshd 30s → `ssh -tt` interactive session that prints `/etc/motd`, fakes a `[ec2-user@host ~]$` prompt before each command, installs `git nodejs npm`, `git clone https://github.com/derek2403/openclaw.git`, drops `.env` (base64-piped from the local Mac's `.env`), runs `bash start.sh`. Designed to be spawned by `demo:final` but standalone-runnable. |
| `npm run chrome:debug` | one-time per session: launches Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` + dedicated user-data-dir (`C:\temp\rh-demo-chrome` on WSL/Win, `~/.rh-demo-chrome` on macOS). User logs into AWS once in this Chrome; cookies persist. |
| `npm run capture-urls` | scrapes fresh AWS OAuth + sign-in URLs from the running debug Chrome via CDP. Prints in shell-eval format. |

### Browser opener: cross-platform

[`axl/mcp-servers/aws-helpers/browser.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws-helpers/browser.ts) — single `openUrl(url)` that detects platform:
- macOS: `open -a "Google Chrome" <url>`
- WSL / Win32: `cmd.exe /c start "" chrome <url>` (uses Windows App Paths registry to find Chrome)
- Linux desktop: `google-chrome <url>` (or `xdg-open` with `BROWSER=default`)

Override with `BROWSER=msedge|firefox|default` env var.

### CDP client (no Playwright)

[`scripts/cdp-helper.ts`](scripts/cdp-helper.ts) — minimal Chrome DevTools Protocol client over `WebSocket` (Node 21+ built-in, no `ws` package needed). Methods: `connect()`, `navigate(url)`, `click(selector)`, `waitForSelector(selector)`, `evaluate(expr)`, `getCurrentUrl()`, `getNavigationHistory()`. ~120 lines total. Used by `demo:cdp` and `capture-urls`.

### URL handling

The default sign-in URL is `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console` (generic — AWS regenerates a fresh PKCE code_challenge on every visit). Don't try to hardcode the long `/oauth?...&code_challenge=...` deep-links: they're single-use, AWS invalidates them after one OAuth round-trip, every reuse returns `400 invalid_request`. This bit us multiple times during dev.

If you want the actual deep-link URLs displayed for narrative, run `eval $(npm run --silent capture-urls)` to populate `SIGNIN_OAUTH_URL` / `SIGNIN_FORM_URL` env vars from the live AWS session, then run `npm run test:browser`.

### Demo flow (default `test:browser` — no setup needed)

```
1. https://aws.amazon.com/free/                                  [auto, 7s]
2. https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console                          [WAIT]   ← user signs in
3. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?…#       [auto, 7s]
4. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?…#Home:      [auto, 7s]
5. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?…#LaunchInstances:   [done]
```

After step 5, the launch-wizard page is open in Chrome. The narrative is "AI navigated to the wizard; instead of clicking through it manually, it'll call AWS RunInstances directly via SDK." That SDK call lives in `demo:cli-only` / `test:aws launch` (currently parked — see below).

## What's built but not currently runnable

[`axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts), [`aws-helpers/ec2.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws-helpers/ec2.ts), [`aws-helpers/ssh.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws-helpers/ssh.ts) and [`scripts/test-aws-direct.ts`](scripts/test-aws-direct.ts) / [`scripts/demo-cli-only.ts`](scripts/demo-cli-only.ts) / [`scripts/demo-full.ts`](scripts/demo-full.ts) implement the SDK side: real EC2 RunInstances + ssh2 install + terminate. They imported `@aws-sdk/client-ec2` + `ssh2` which were dropped from `package.json`. To re-enable:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps @aws-sdk/client-ec2@^3 ssh2@^1.16 @types/ssh2
```

Plus AWS access key in `~/.aws/credentials`, EC2 keypair `nanoclaw-key` saved as `axl/nanoclaw-key.pem` (chmod 600). Defaults: us-east-1, t2.micro, AMI `ami-0c02fb55956c7d316`.

**The CLI-based path (`demo:final` / `demo:cli-aws`) is the working alternative** — same outcome (real EC2 launch + remote install) without any `@aws-sdk` or `ssh2` deps, since it shells out to the system `aws` and `ssh` binaries. If you only need the demo flow, prefer this path. If you need programmatic SDK access from inside the AXL/MCP server (e.g. for `aws.ts` to be reachable over the mesh), you still need to reinstall the SDK deps as above.

### Gotchas for `demo:cli-aws`

- **Required IAM permissions.** The IAM user needs `AmazonEC2FullAccess` + `AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess` (or a custom policy with `ec2:CreateKeyPair`, `ec2:RunInstances`, `ec2:Describe*`, `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`, `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`, `ec2:CreateTags`, `ec2:TerminateInstances`, `ssm:GetParameter`). Without SSM access the AMI lookup fails.
- **AWS Free Plan only allows specific instance types.** New accounts (post-2024 Free Plan) reject `t2.micro` with `InvalidParameterCombination`. The script defaults to `t3.micro`. If even that's rejected, run `aws ec2 describe-instance-types --filters Name=free-tier-eligible,Values=true --region us-east-1` to see what's allowed.
- **Default VPC must exist** in the chosen region. `aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters Name=isDefault,Values=true --region us-east-1` should return a VPC. If it doesn't, the script needs `--subnet-id`.
- **`.env` is base64-piped, not scp'd.** The local `.env` is read on Mac, base64-encoded, and inlined inside the install script's bash payload. Decoded on EC2, written to `~/openclaw/.env`, chmod 600. Sidesteps shell-escape issues with newlines/quotes/specials in secrets. Logs never contain the decoded content because the install script runs over an interactive `ssh -tt` session.
- **Keypair recovery.** If the AWS keypair `openclaw-demo-key` exists but the local PEM at `axl/openclaw-demo-key.pem` is missing, the script aborts (it can't re-mint a PEM for an existing key). Recover with `aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name openclaw-demo-key --region us-east-1` then re-run.
- **Long-running `start.sh` keeps SSH open.** The interactive `ssh -tt` doesn't return until the remote command exits. If `start.sh` runs a server in the foreground, the popup terminal stays connected — that's good for the demo (audience sees the server log live). To detach cleanly: type `~.` in the SSH session, or have `start.sh` background its server with `nohup … &`.

## What's parked, ready to wire (the AXL/MCP integration)

The full Phase 2a vision was: a remote agent on Mac B (`agent-b`) calls AXL's `/mcp/<user-peer>/aws` endpoint → AXL forwards through Yggdrasil to user's Mac → vendored `mcp-router.py` (port 9003) dispatches → `aws.ts` MCP server (port 9100) prompts approval → runs the demo flow.

These pieces exist:
- [`axl/mcp-router.py`](axl/mcp-router.py) — vendored verbatim from `gensyn-ai/axl/integrations/mcp_routing/`
- [`axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts) — Express MCP service exposing 4 tools (`open_console`, `launch_instance`, `show_in_console`, `install_nanoclaw`)
- [`axl/mcp-servers/permission.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/permission.ts) — terminal y/n approval gate (serialised via promise chain so concurrent calls don't race on stdin)
- [`scripts/mcp-call.ts`](scripts/mcp-call.ts) — sender CLI: `npm run mcp:call -- <role> <svc> <tool> '<args>'`
- [`scripts/setup-axl.sh`](scripts/setup-axl.sh) already adds `router_addr` + `router_port=9003` to `node-config.json` for the user role, and pip-installs `aiohttp`
- [`scripts/axl-start.sh`](scripts/axl-start.sh) already background-starts `mcp-router.py` + `aws.ts` on the user role and monitors them in the polling loop

What's missing for the AXL integration to work:
1. The aforementioned `@aws-sdk/client-ec2` + `ssh2` deps so `aws.ts` compiles
2. Replace the hardcoded `aws.ts` tools with calls into the **standalone demo scripts** above (so the AXL-routed flow is the same browser walk + SDK launch + SSH install we already have working locally) — i.e. pivot `aws.ts`'s tool implementations from "do the work directly" to "spawn `tsx scripts/demo-before.ts` etc. as child processes"
3. Confirm the AXL-side wiring on a real 3-Mac mesh: agent-b runs `mcp-call user aws walk_through` → user's Mac shows approval prompt + runs the demo

### Verified MCP request shape (from gensyn-ai/axl/integrations/mcp_routing/mcp_router.py)

Sender:
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:9002/mcp/<peer-pubkey>/aws
{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"tools/call", "params":{"name":"...","arguments":{...}} }
```

AXL forwards to `router_addr:router_port` (`http://127.0.0.1:9003/route`):
```
{ "service":"aws", "request": <jsonrpc-above>, "from_peer_id":"<28hex>" }
```

Router POSTs the inner `request` body to the registered service's `/mcp` endpoint with headers `X-From-Peer-Id` (use `matchesPeer()` from `axl/axl.ts` — header is truncated to ~28 hex), `X-Service`. Service prompts approval, runs the tool, returns:
```
{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "result":{ "content":[{"type":"text","text":"<json-stringified result>"}] } }
```

Router wraps as `{response: <jsonrpc>, error: null}` and the response propagates back through AXL to the sender.

# Telegram bot — OpenClaw on 0G Compute (Phase 2a EC2 payload)

The standalone Telegram bot that gets deployed onto the user's EC2 box once `launch_instance` succeeds. Long-polls Telegram, routes inbound messages through 0G Compute Network's `qwen-2.5-7b-instruct` provider, returns replies with provider/tx hyperlinks in an HTML footer.

Lives in [`telegram-bot/`](telegram-bot/) as its own npm project — designed to clone+run on any Linux box with Node 20+, no parent-repo deps.

## Why this matters

Phase 2a's narrative is "agents on Mac B/C deploy a working AI service onto the user's EC2." Until this bot existed, the demo ended at "EC2 instance is running" — abstract. With the bot installed, the user opens Telegram on their phone, finds **@RightHandAI_OpenClaw**, and chats with an LLM that lives on their just-launched EC2 and pays for inference from a 0G testnet ledger — concrete, visible, real.

## Files

```

  bot.ts            # grammy long-poll → 0G compute (qwen-2.5-7b) → reply.
                    # HTML footer with provider-address explorer link
                    # + on-chain ack tx hash when one fires.

  .gitignore        # node_modules, .env, *.log
  README.md         # setup, PM2/systemd recipes, troubleshooting
```

## How it integrates with Phase 2a

The bot lives at [github.com/derek2403/openclaw](https://github.com/derek2403/openclaw) as its own repo (extracted from `telegram-bot/` for distribution). The **working integration path is `demo:cli-aws`** ([`scripts/demo-cli-aws.ts`](scripts/demo-cli-aws.ts)), which does the equivalent of:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git nodejs npm
git clone https://github.com/derek2403/openclaw.git ~/openclaw
cd ~/openclaw
cat <<'EOF' > .env   # base64-piped from the local Mac's .env
BOT_TOKEN=…
0G_PRIVATE_KEY=…
EOF
chmod 600 .env
bash start.sh
```

…all over a single `ssh -tt` session that streams the remote AL2023 motd + a faked `[ec2-user@host ~]$ <cmd>` prompt before each command, so the audience watches it run live in the popup terminal. The `.env` is base64-encoded on the Mac, inlined into the install script, and decoded on EC2 — no scp, no leaked secrets in logs.

The `install_telegram_bot` MCP tool in [`axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts`](axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts) (still to be wired) is the AXL-routed equivalent: same SSH calls, but invoked as a JSON-RPC tool over the AXL mesh + MCP router instead of from a local Mac terminal. When it's wired, it should `child_process.spawn('tsx', ['scripts/demo-cli-aws.ts'])` rather than re-implementing the SSH dance.

After install, the user opens [t.me/RightHandAI_OpenClaw](https://t.me/RightHandAI_OpenClaw), sends `/start`, and chats. Every reply is qwen inference billed against the 0G ledger.

## 0G Compute integration

Mirrors the `callVia0GCompute()` function in [`pages/api/0g/inft-infer.ts`](pages/api/0g/inft-infer.ts) exactly — same broker setup (`createZGComputeNetworkBroker(wallet)`), same env var (`0G_PRIVATE_KEY`), same provider call sequence. The bot uses **only the qwen-2.5-7b provider** because it's the only chat model registered on 0G testnet right now (run `tsx check.ts` to confirm).

Per-message flow:
1. `broker.inference.acknowledged(provider)` — read, free
2. `broker.inference.acknowledgeProviderSigner(provider)` — **on-chain tx** on first call to a new provider; cached after
3. `broker.inference.getServiceMetadata(provider)` — read endpoint + model name
4. `broker.inference.getRequestHeaders(provider, message)` — signs request off-chain
5. `fetch(endpoint + "/chat/completions", { headers })` — actual inference (OpenAI-compatible)
6. `broker.inference.processResponse(provider, chatID, reply)` — billing settle (silent on failure)

The bot hooks `wallet.sendTransaction` to capture step 2's tx hash and surfaces it as a hyperlink in the reply footer when present.

## Boot UI

The branded boot is in two layers:

1. **`start.sh`** prints the red-bordered lobster banner before launching node.
2. **`bot.ts`** then runs a 5-step staged init that runs *real* on-chain probes and prints each as a dotted leader line:
   ```
   [ 1/5 ]  ▸ loading 0g compute broker .................  ✓
   [ 2/5 ]  ▸ probing 0g testnet ........................  ✓ gas 12.85 0G · chain 16602
   [ 3/5 ]  ▸ reading ledger ............................  ✓ 7.49 0G allocated
   [ 4/5 ]  ▸ acknowledging providers ...................  ✓ qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
   [ 5/5 ]  ▸ pairing telegram channel ..................  ✓ @RightHandAI_OpenClaw
   ```
3. Finishes with `EXFOLIATE! OpenClaw is online.` Shutdown gets `─ shutting down — the lobster sleeps 🦞`.

The vibe is borrowed from [github.com/openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (their tagline, lobster mascot, CLI-first aesthetic).

## Gotchas

- **0G SDK ESM build is broken** as of `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker@0.7.8` — exports a missing `'C'` constant. The bot is CommonJS (no `"type": "module"` in `package.json`) so it pulls the working CJS build. Don't add `"type": "module"` back.
- **`0G_PRIVATE_KEY` starts with a digit.** JS can't access via `process.env.0G_PRIVATE_KEY` directly — always use `process.env["0G_PRIVATE_KEY"]` (square-bracket form). Matches the parent monorepo.
- **Bot username is auto-detected at runtime** via grammy's `getMe()`. Don't hardcode `@RightHandAI_OpenClaw` anywhere except docs/banners; if you rename via @BotFather, the boot screen reflects it on next restart.
- **On-chain tx per call only fires on first ack.** After that, all communication goes through the broker's off-chain HTTP path. Subsequent replies still link the provider contract address — that's a real on-chain artifact, just not per-call.
- **`.env.example` and `package-lock.json` are force-tracked.** The parent `.gitignore` excludes `.env*` and `package-lock.json` repo-wide; the bot dir overrides via `git add -f` (one-time at initial commit). When adding new bot files matching parent-ignored patterns, may need `git add -f` again.
- **In-memory chat history wipes on restart.** Persist to Redis if you need durability; PM2/nohup don't preserve it.
- **One Telegram polling consumer per bot token.** If you migrate machines or run a duplicate, the second one fails with `409 Conflict`. To clear: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/deleteWebhook`.
- **The 0G SDK references `window.location` at module-load.** `bot.ts` shims `globalThis.window` before importing the SDK — don't reorder those imports.

# Chat UI prototype (Right-Hand workspace + host console)

The user-facing front of Right-Hand AI: a chat interface that simulates dispatching tasks to ENS-discovered specialists, plus a host console for the seller side. Currently mocked — no real backend wiring. Mock data lives in [`lib/mock-data.ts`](lib/mock-data.ts), the orchestration is a `setTimeout`-driven state machine in [`lib/task-runner.ts`](lib/task-runner.ts). It's the demo narrative layer, not the production runtime.

## Pages

```

## Two interaction patterns inside the chat

**Approve/Deny** (used by Japan / WiFi / AWS-config / default flows): the assistant message renders an `ApprovalCard` showing one shell command. User clicks Approve or Deny. Used when the agent has fully decided and just wants permission for a sensitive action.

**Clarify** (used by the AWS+OpenClaw demo flow): when `script.clarifies` is set, `task-runner` pauses the run mid-flight and renders one [`ClarifyCard`](components/chat/ClarifyCard.tsx) per round. Each card has N multiple-choice questions; the user picks one option per question and clicks Continue. Modeled after Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`. When all questions in a card are answered, the run resumes — and the final report's `reportItems` get template-interpolated with the picks (`{region}` → `us-east-1`, `{instanceType}` → `t3.micro`, etc.).

The AWS+OpenClaw demo runs **two** clarify rounds, one per specialist:

```
prompt: "Deploy OpenClaw on a fresh EC2 instance"
  ↓
[Resolving specialists via ENS] → [Establishing AXL channels] → [Dispatching to AWS Provisioning]
  ↓
ClarifyCard #1 (AWS Provisioning Specialist):
  Q: Which AWS region?       → us-east-1 / us-west-2 / eu-west-1 / ap-southeast-1
  Q: What instance size?     → t3.micro / t3.small / t3.medium
  ↓ Continue
[Dispatching to OpenClaw Deployment]
  ↓
ClarifyCard #2 (OpenClaw Deployment Specialist):
  Q: Which OpenClaw version? → 0.6.2 / 0.7.0-rc
  Q: Admin password?         → Auto-generated / Prompted on install
  ↓ Continue
[Synthesizing final report]
  ↓
Final report — items interpolated with picks
```

## task-runner state machine

[`useTaskRunner()`](lib/task-runner.ts) returns `{ messages, run, busy, pendingApproval, pendingClarify, submit, resolveApproval, resolveClarify }`.

Two flow paths chosen by whether `script.clarifies` is present:

- **Approval flow**: step animation → approval card → on approve: more step animation → final report.
- **Clarify flow**: step animation → clarify[0] card → on submit: step animation + clarify[1] card → on submit: synthesis step → final report. Handles N clarify rounds (one per specialist).

Timing is `setTimeout`-driven via an `at(ms, fn)` helper. All timers clear on unmount or new submit. Phases progress through the `RunPhase` enum (`routing → discovering → executing → clarify | approval → finishing → done`).

## How prompts route to flows

`mode` (Solo/Pair/Swarm/Deep) trims or extends the specialist list **after** the branch picks them.

## Tailwind setup

The repo runs **Tailwind v4** (`@import "tailwindcss"` in `globals.css`, `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin). Custom theme tokens live in a `@theme` block in [`styles/globals.css`](styles/globals.css), **not a `tailwind.config.ts`**. Tokens: `bg-bg`, `bg-surface{,-2,-3}`, `text-ink{,-2,-3,-4}`, `border-border{,-strong}`, `bg-accent{,-soft,-fg}`, `shadow-{xs,sm,md}`, `text-2xs`. Fonts: Inter + JetBrains Mono via Google Fonts import in the same file.

## Gotchas

- **All data is mocked.** `HOSTED_AGENTS` and `RECENT_INVOCATIONS` in `lib/mock-data.ts` are fake — not derived from ENS or any contract. By design — the chat UI is the *narrative* layer; actual agent execution lives in Phase 2a's `axl/` + the `demo:final` pipeline.
- **`AppShell`'s grid item children need `h-full` to span row height.** [`TaskProgressPanel`](components/chat/TaskProgressPanel.tsx)'s `<aside>` has `h-full` on it — without that, the content collapses to its natural height while the wrapper grid cell stays full-height, leaving an unstyled gap below. Same pattern applies to any new aside-style panel under `AppShell`.
- **Per-message clarify state is preserved on the `AssistantMessage`** as `clarifies: ClarifyState[]`. Once answered, the card locks (radio shows the pick, no Continue button) — re-rendering the message later still shows the chosen answers. `pendingClarify` is just an index pointer to the active card.
- **Path alias is `@/*` from repo root.** Imports look like `@/components/chat/ClarifyCard`. Configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- **The chat UI is not at `/`.** When it landed, the original AXL transport demo at `/` was preserved; the new chat lives at `/landing`. If you ever want to promote the chat to `/`, move the AXL demo to a sub-route first — don't overwrite.
- **`_app.tsx` wraps everything in `<Providers>` (RainbowKit/wagmi/react-query) AND `<Head>`** with title + viewport. Don't drop either when editing.

# Phase 2b — ENS task marketplace + royalties (next)

Phase 2a wires execution. Phase 2b turns the demo into the real product flow: **a user posts a task on ENS, OpenClaw specialists bid/sign in, the elected swarm coordinates over AXL, and MCP performs the actual work on the user's machine.**

## End-to-end target flow

```
1. User types a goal in chat                e.g. "install OpenClaw and run sample agent"
        │
        ▼
2. Task posted to ENS                       new ENS subname or text record under the
                                            user's own domain — describes the task,
                                            required skills, max budget, deadline
        │
        ▼
3. OpenClaw bots discover & opt in          listening to ENS task events; specialists
                                            with matching `skills` text records sign
                                            (on-chain or signed-message) to claim
                                            participation. Auto-elected by skill match
                                            + reputation + price.
        │
        ▼
4. Swarm assembled                          coordinator + N specialists, each on its
                                            own AXL node. The user's machine joins as
                                            the `user` role.
        │
        ▼
5. AXL coordination                         coordinator orchestrates via /a2a/{peer}.
                                            Specialists collaborate, share state on
                                            0G Storage workspace, log results. (This
                                            is what Phase 1's CC-pattern proves.)
        │
        ▼
6. MCP control of user's machine            specialists invoke approved tools on the
                                            user's PC via /mcp/{user-peer}/{service}.
                                            Each call surfaces a permission prompt;
                                            user approves before any local action runs.
        │
        ▼
7. Royalties paid                           per-call fees in 0G tokens (or x402/USDC)
                                            to each participating iNFT owner, plus a
                                            mint-time license fee for any user who
                                            chooses to run a local instance.
```

## What needs building (Phase 2b scope)

> **Note:** `TaskMarket` is now shipped — see the **ENS task marketplace** section above. The bullets below are what's still pending.

- **Specialist subscription daemon.** Each OpenClaw specialist runs a watcher (background process or AXL-registered hook) that filters `TaskPosted` events by skill match. On match, it auto-signs.
- **Coordinator selection.** First-N-to-sign-on, or weighted by reputation/price. Probably runs as one of the agent roles in the AXL mesh — same agent.ts shape, different agent card.
- **More MCP services beyond `aws`.** Phase 2a only ships the `aws` service. Add `filesystem`, `terminal`, `git`, etc. — each a sibling of `axl/mcp-servers/aws.ts` that self-registers with the router.
- **Web-based permission UI.** Phase 2a uses a terminal y/n prompt. Phase 2b should pop a modal in the user's chat UI: "Specialist `postgres-debug` wants to run `psql -c '\\l'`. [Approve] [Deny]." Bundled into the local connector binary.
- **Royalty router.** Each successful task call triggers an on-chain payment to the iNFT owner (looked up via the `0g_token_id` ENS text record). Could route through the existing `SpecialistRegistrar` contract or a new `RoyaltyRouter`.

## File map (Phase 2b — to be created)

```
contracts/
  contracts/RoyaltyRouter.sol            # per-call payment splits
axl/
  coordinator.ts                         # agent role variant: orchestrates swarm
  specialists/
    postgres-debug.ts                    # example skill-specialised agent.ts
    openclaw-setup.ts
  mcp-servers/                           # Phase 2a already ships `aws.ts`; add more siblings:
    filesystem.ts                        # local tool: file read/write with approval
    terminal.ts                          # local tool: shell exec with approval
connector/                               # the eventual single-binary connector
  permission-ui.tsx                      # Electron/Tauri permission UI
  bundle.json                            # AXL + MCP servers + UI packaging
```

## Key design notes

- **Tasks live on ENS, not in a centralised DB.** Each task is an ENS subname (or a text record on the user's own domain) with structured skill/budget/deadline fields. This composes naturally with the existing specialist registry — both are ENS records, both are discoverable the same way.
- **Sign-on is on-chain.** Specialists "sign" by calling a contract method, not by a centralised auction. This makes the swarm formation auditable and makes ownership claims unambiguous (whoever called `signOn` first wins the slot).
- **MCP is the execution moat.** Phase 1 proves transport (`/send`, `/a2a`); Phase 2 proves *execution on the user's machine* — that's what Right-Hand AI sells. The CC pattern from Phase 1 carries forward as the user's per-action approval log.
- **One iNFT per specialist, registered as ENS subname.** The existing `SpecialistRegistrar` contract already handles this. Phase 2 adds the *task* contract alongside.
- **Phase 1 demo is the foundation.** The `axl/agent.ts` echo flow becomes the coordinator-↔-specialist handshake. The `axl-send.ts` CC pattern becomes the user-visible audit trail of agent traffic. The `peers.json` pubkey roster generalises to "any specialist that signed on for this task."
